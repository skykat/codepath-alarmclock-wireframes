# codepath-alarmclock-wireframes

These are the inital wireframes for our alarm clock app for Karen Levy and @davidkuchar.
The idea is to tell the app your destination, and it will set an alaram when you are 5 miles or 5 minutes away from your destination. It should take into account traffic and mode of travel. This is most helpful when using public transit. We plan on using Google Maps or the HERE api to determine transit information.
